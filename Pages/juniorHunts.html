                <p>Arizona provides many opportunities for youth to get involved in hunting.  We, at Crawford Guide Service, take great pride in assisting our junior hunters by making an extra effort to ensure that every junior hunt is both an enjoyable and educational experience.  We take seriously our responsibility to introduce our youth to the American tradition of hunting, and to provide the guidance needed to teach the next generation of hunters how to be safe, responsible stewards, and ethical hunters.
                    <br><br>
                Who is a junior hunter?  Youths aged 10 to 13 years, possessing a hunter’s safety card and youths aged14 years to throughout the calendar year of their 17th birthday, with or without a safety card.
                    <br><br>
                Arizona Game and Fish provides Junior Hunter Only hunts with reduced fees and so do we.</p>

                        Although there isn’t a junior only quail season, quail hunting is a terrific way to introduce our youth to hunting!  Quail hunting provides plenty of shooting opportunities to help teach firearms safety, and has the added benefit of providing lots of action. Quail Season is November 25th - February 5th
